# World_Weather_Analysis

The purpose of this assignment was to use Weather and Google Maps API to create a list of potential travel destinations and hotels based on the user entry of a maximum temperature preference. 


**Weather_Database**: This folder holds a jupyter notebook and csv file with weather information for cities found from 2000 randomized latitude and longitude coordinates. 

**Vacation_Search**: This pulls in the csv file from above and combines the cities with the nearest hotels available, as well as limits the dataframe to cities that fall within the temperature requirements of the user. A map with descriptive markers is included for ease of use



**Vacation_Itinerary**: This takes the user entries for their vacation start and end points, as well as the waystops, and maps them with markers that include current weather information
